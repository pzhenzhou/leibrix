# Master System Architecture: Distributed In-Memory Acceleration Layer

## 1. Guiding Principles for Revision

This architecture document presents a revised, simplified design for the Master component. The primary goals of this revision are to reduce complexity, eliminate premature generalization, and improve developer productivity by adhering to the YAGNI ("You Ain't Gonna Need It") principle.

The key changes focus on:
- **Module Consolidation:** Grouping closely related functions into more cohesive packages to reduce fragmentation and boilerplate.
- **Abstraction Simplification:** Retaining only the interfaces that provide immediate, clear value for extension or decoupling, and favoring concrete implementations for other functionalities.

## 3. Overall Architecture

The Master is the central coordination component of the distributed, memory-centric acceleration layer. It acts as a stateful control plane, orchestrating data placement and lifecycle across a cluster of Worker nodes without managing the data itself. By leveraging a distributed consensus store (etcd), it maintains the global state of the cluster, including worker status and data assignments. Its primary role is to ensure that hot data from the underlying data lakehouse (e.g., Iceberg tables, OLAP snapshots) is available in memory on the correct Workers, ready to be queried with low latency via the Data Gateway.

The system follows a **master-worker** architecture where the Master is the brain and the Workers are the high-performance data engines. The data onboarding and assignment flow is as follows:

1.  **Admission Request**: An external administrator or service interacts with the Master's `ManagementService` gRPC API to request that a specific dataset be loaded into the speed layer.
2.  **Admission Control**: The Master's internal **Admission Controller** receives this request. It connects to the underlying data source (e.g., Iceberg catalog) to resolve the request into a concrete set of data files, schema, and partition information.
3.  **Load Plan Generation**: The Admission Controller generates a detailed `LoadPlan`. This plan is an explicit, immutable recipe that tells a Worker exactly what data to pull and how to load it.
4.  **Data Assignment**: The Master determines which Worker(s) should handle the `LoadPlan` and persists this assignment in `etcd`.
5.  **Notify & Pull**: The Master sends a `DataAssignmentEvent`, containing the `LoadPlan`, over the persistent gRPC stream to the designated Workers.
6.  **Caching & Serving**: Workers pull the immutable data directly from the source as specified in the `LoadPlan`, load it into their in-memory engine (DuckDB), and report their status as `READY`. The Data Gateway can then route queries for that data epoch.

This architecture treats the in-memory layer as a **CPU cache for the data lakehouse**. It holds the hottest, most frequently accessed data subsets in a high-speed medium (RAM) to accelerate queries, while the larger, colder dataset remains in the lakehouse.

## 4. Master Cluster Management

To ensure high availability and prevent a single point of failure, the Master is deployed as a distributed cluster. It leverages an embedded `etcd` instance for all coordination, state management, and consensus, aligning with Go's principles of simplicity and robust concurrency.

### Master Membership and Leader Election

-   **Membership**: Each Master node registers itself in `etcd` upon startup by creating a key under a well-defined prefix (e.g., `/masters/{master_id}`). This registration includes its gRPC endpoint for intra-cluster communication if needed.
-   **Leader Election**: The cluster elects a single active leader using `etcd`'s built-in election API, which is based on the RAFT consensus algorithm. The leader is responsible for making all critical decisions, such as data assignments and worker notifications. Follower nodes remain on standby, ready to take over if the leader fails. They use `etcd` watches to observe state changes made by the leader and maintain a consistent view.
-   **Failover**: If the leader node fails, its `etcd` session will time out, and its leadership lease will expire. The `etcd` election library ensures that one of the followers will be promptly elected as the new leader, minimizing downtime.

## 5. Worker Status Management

The Master is solely responsible for tracking the health and status of all Worker nodes. Workers are designed to be simple and unaware of `etcd`; they communicate with the Master exclusively via a persistent, bidirectional gRPC stream. This event-driven approach simplifies the communication model and ensures real-time state synchronization.

-   **Connection & Registration**: On startup, a Worker establishes a long-lived gRPC stream to the Master by calling the `EventStream` RPC. The first event it sends on this stream is a `RegisterEvent`. The Master (leader) accepts this event, creates a new lease in `etcd`, associates it with the Worker's key (e.g., `/workers/{tenant_id}/{worker_id}`), and sends back a `RegistrationAckEvent`.
-   **Heartbeat**: The Worker then periodically sends `HeartbeatEvent` messages on the stream to signal its liveness. On receiving a heartbeat, the Master refreshes (keeps alive) the Worker's lease in `etcd`.
-   **Failure Detection**: If the gRPC stream breaks or the Master stops receiving heartbeats within the lease's Time-To-Live (TTL), the lease expires. `etcd` automatically deletes the associated Worker key. The Master uses an `etcd` watch to detect this deletion and marks the Worker as `offline`. This triggers a rebalancing of any data assignments that the failed Worker held.

### Sequence Flow: Worker Event Stream

  |                        |                           |
```

## 6. Admission Control and Data Onboarding

The **Admission Controller** is a logical component within the Master responsible for managing the data lifecycle in the speed layer. It acts as the gatekeeper, translating high-level requests into concrete, executable `LoadPlan`s for the workers.

-   **Entry Point**: The controller is exposed via the external `ManagementService` gRPC API. This allows administrators or automated systems to declaratively state which data should be accelerated.
-   **Responsibilities**:
    1.  **Request Validation**: It validates incoming `AdmitDatasetRequest` messages, ensuring the specified tenant and data source are valid.
    2.  **Source Interrogation**: It connects to the external data source (e.g., an Iceberg catalog) to resolve the request. For example, it translates a request for "the last 7 days of the `sales` table" into a specific list of manifest files, data files, and the corresponding table schema for that snapshot.
    3.  **LoadPlan Generation**: It constructs the detailed, immutable `LoadPlan`. This plan contains all the physical information a worker needs, removing any ambiguity and ensuring workers do not need to contain complex source-specific logic.
    4.  **Quota Enforcement**: Admission applies per-tenant and global memory budgets before a `LoadPlan` is persisted. It consults the Capacity Planner to ensure the resulting footprint keeps the cluster within reserved allocations.
    5.  **Idempotency & Auditing**: Every request receives a deterministic identifier. The controller persists its status transitions (`PENDING`, `PLANNED`, `ASSIGNED`, `FAILED`) so callers can safely retry without duplicating work. Audit trails are exported via the observability module.

## 7. Data Assignment and Sharding

The system does not perform traditional database sharding. Instead, it manages the assignment of **immutable data epochs**, as defined by a `LoadPlan`, to workers. The process is initiated by the Admission Controller.

-   **Assignment Logic**: Once a `LoadPlan` is generated, the Master leader selects available Workers based on a load balancing strategy.
    -   **Round-Robin**: Simple and effective for homogenous clusters.
    -   **Hash-Based**: A consistent hashing algorithm can be used to map a data epoch to a Worker. This minimizes reassignments when Workers are added or removed.
    -   **Capacity-Aware**: The Master considers worker capacity (CPU, available memory) reported in `HeartbeatEvent` messages to make more intelligent assignments.
-   **Rebalancing**: The Master watches the `/workers/` prefix in `etcd`.
    -   **Worker Added**: When a new worker key appears, the Master may trigger a rebalancing to offload some data assignments from existing workers to the new one to distribute load.
    -   **Worker Removed**: When a worker key is deleted (due to failure), the Master reassigns its data epochs to other healthy workers.
-   **Persistence**: All data assignments are persisted in `etcd` under a key like `/assignments/{tenant_id}/{dataset_id}/{epoch_id}`. The value would contain the `LoadPlan` and the list of `worker_id`s responsible for it.

## 8. Multi-Tenancy Support

Multi-tenancy is a first-class citizen in the architecture, enforced at multiple levels by the Master. The central principle is that **a Worker belongs exclusively to one Tenant at a time**. This ensures strict resource isolation.

-   **Data Isolation**: All data assignments in `etcd` are namespaced by `tenant_id`, making it impossible for one tenant's configuration to affect another.
-   **Resource Quotas**: Tenant configurations stored under `/tenants/{tenant_id}/config` define hard limits on resources (e.g., total memory, CPU cores). The Master's assignment logic respects these quotas, refusing to assign new data epochs if a tenant would exceed its allocation.
-   **Worker Allocation**: A tenant is mapped to a pool of one or more workers. The `tenant_id` is a mandatory field in the worker's initial `RegisterEvent` and is used to scope its key in `etcd` (`/workers/{tenant_id}/{worker_id}`). This prevents cross-tenant data assignments.
-   **gRPC Stream Context**: The `tenant_id` is present in every `EventStreamMessage`, ensuring that all communication is correctly scoped and authorized. The Master's gRPC handler will validate that the worker is registered to the tenant it claims to represent.

## 9. RPC Connection Management and Reliability Policy

All communication between the Master and external actors (Admins and Workers) happens via gRPC. The Master provides two public services: `ManagementService` (control plane operations) and `ControlPlaneService` (worker coordination). The platform enforces consistent connection, retry, and timeout strategies.

### 9.1 ManagementService (Unary RPCs)

-   **Client Expectations**: External callers (CLI, automation) issue unary RPCs. Each call must include a tenant-scoped authentication token and an idempotency key.
-   **Server Policies**:
    -   **Deadlines**: The server enforces a default 5s deadline for admission-related reads and a 60s deadline for long-running mutations.
    -   **Retry Semantics**: The API designates retryable errors (`UNAVAILABLE`, `ABORTED`) with a `retry-after-ms` hint for exponential backoff.
    -   **Validation & Quota Failures**: Invalid parameters return `INVALID_ARGUMENT`; budget rejections return `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.

### 9.2 ControlPlaneService (Bidirectional Streams)

-   **Connection Lifecycle**: Workers establish a long-lived stream. The Master authenticates the worker and registers the stream.
-   **Timeouts & Heartbeats**: Workers must send a heartbeat every 5s. Missing three causes the Master to proactively close the stream. The Master also sends keepalive pings every 15s to detect half-open connections.
-   **Backpressure & Flow Control**: Load assignments are pushed with credit-based flow control.
-   **Error Handling**: Recoverable stream-level errors use `UNAVAILABLE` with a retry delay hint. Workers back off exponentially before reconnecting.

## 10. gRPC Protocols

gRPC is the communication backbone for the system. Two primary services are defined:
-   `ControlPlaneService`: For internal, real-time communication between the Master and Workers.
-   `ManagementService`: For external, administrative control over the Master.

### `control_plane_service.proto`

## 11. Master Module Map and Package Layout

The Master codebase is organized into a domain-oriented package structure that balances separation of concerns with low cognitive overhead. The layout distinguishes between core business logic, foundational platform services, and transport handling.

| Package Path            | Category        | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cmd/master`            | Application     | The binary entry point; responsible for initializing and running the application.                                                                                              |
| `internal/master`       | **Business Logic** | The core of the control plane. Contains the primary logic for `admission`, `assignment`, and `cluster` management (worker tracking). This package is what makes the Master a master. |
| `internal/transport/grpc` | Transport Layer | Implements the gRPC service handlers (`ManagementService`, `ControlPlaneService`), manages the server lifecycle, and handles stream management for worker communication.    |
| `internal/store`        | **Platform Service** | Provides a simplified, high-level interface over the `etcd` client for KV, lease, leader election, and transaction operations. It serves all needs related to cluster state and configuration. |
| `internal/catalog`      | **Platform Service** | Abstracts clients for interacting with external metadata sources (e.g., Iceberg catalogs). Used by the admission logic to resolve logical requests into physical data plans. |
| `internal/platform/*`   | **Platform Services** | A collection of truly generic, application-agnostic building blocks. Initially contains `observability` (metrics, logging) and `security` (mTLS, auth).                  |
| `internal/api/v1`       | API Definitions | Contains the generated Protobuf code, defining the service contracts.                                                                                                         |

## 12. Core Abstractions and Design Philosophy

This revised design significantly reduces the number of core abstractions, favoring concrete implementations until an abstraction is clearly warranted. This approach reduces complexity, minimizes boilerplate, and improves traceability.

### Retained Abstractions (Interfaces)

1.  **`catalog.Connector`**:
    *   **Description:** An interface within the `internal/catalog` package that abstracts interactions with a specific type of external metadata source.
    *   **Justification:** This is the primary extension point for supporting new data sources (e.g., OLAP databases) without changing the core admission logic in `internal/master`.

2.  **`master.AssignmentStrategy`**:
    *   **Description:** An interface within the `internal/master` package that defines `Select(plan LoadPlan, candidates []WorkerInfo) ([]Assignment, error)`, enabling pluggable placement policies.
    *   **Justification:** Worker selection and data placement logic is a natural point of extension and evolution (e.g., from round-robin to capacity-aware).

3.  **`observability.AuditLogger`**:
    *   **Description:** An interface within `internal/platform/observability` for emitting append-only audit events for admissions, assignments, and failovers.
    *   **Justification:** Auditing is a distinct, cross-cutting concern. An interface allows the backend to be changed (e.g., from a log file to a dedicated service) without impacting business logic.

### Eliminated Abstractions (Now Concrete Implementations)

-   **Leader Election:** Handled by a concrete implementation within the `internal/store` package, wrapping the `etcd` client library.
-   **Worker Liveness & Directory:** Managed directly within `internal/master` by using the `internal/store` to watch `etcd` leases and keys.
-   **Admission Workflow:** These steps (validation, planning, quotas) are now concrete functions within the `internal/master` package.
-   **Worker Event Streaming:** Replaced by a concrete `StreamRegistry` within `internal/transport/grpc` to manage active worker connections.
-   **Configuration & Quota Management:** Handled by direct calls to the `internal/store`, which reads the required data from `etcd`.

## 13. Etcd Key Organization

A well-defined `etcd` key structure is critical for discoverability, atomic operations, and efficient watches. We adopt a hierarchical, tenant-aware key schema.

```text
/
├── masters/
│   └── {master_id} -> {"address": "host:port"} (Ephemeral, for membership)
│
├── election/
│   └── master -> {leader_id} (Leased, for leader election)
│
├── workers/
│   └── {tenant_id}/
│       └── {worker_id} -> {"address": "host:port", "capacity": {...}} (Leased, for liveness)
│
├── assignments/
│   └── {tenant_id}/
│       └── {dataset_id}/
│           └── {epoch_id} -> {"workers": ["worker_a", "worker_b"], "status": "READY", "load_plan": {...}}
│
├── tenants/
│   └── {tenant_id}/
│       ├── config -> {"memory_quota_gb": 1024, "cpu_quota": 8}
│       └── datasets/
│           └── {dataset_id} -> {"source_type": "iceberg", "source_uri": "..."}
│
└── config/
    └── global -> {"log_level": "info", "default_ttl_sec": 30}

```

-   `/masters/{master_id}`: Used for Master cluster membership.
-   `/election/master`: A single key used for the leader election protocol.
-   `/workers/{tenant_id}/{worker_id}`: Tracks live workers per tenant. Leased keys ensure automatic cleanup on failure.
-   `/assignments/{tenant_id}/{dataset_id}/{epoch_id}`: The core data mapping. Stores the `LoadPlan` and the worker assignments for a given data epoch.
-   `/tenants/{tenant_id}`: Stores all configuration and metadata for a specific tenant, such as resource quotas and source definitions.
-   `/config/global`: For cluster-wide settings.

## 14. Additional Details

### Configuration Management

-   **Source**: All static configuration for tenants and global settings is stored directly in `etcd`.
-   **Hot-Reload**: The Master uses `etcd` watches on its configuration prefixes (e.g., `/config/global`, `/tenants/`). When a config value is updated, the watch is triggered, and the Master reloads its configuration in memory without requiring a restart.

### Logging and Monitoring

-   **Logging**: The Master will use a structured logging library like `uber-go/zap`. Logs will be written as JSON and include contextual fields like `tenant_id`, `worker_id`, and `trace_id`.
-   **Monitoring**: The Master will expose key metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
    -   `master_leader_status`: 1 if the current node is leader, 0 otherwise.
    -   `master_workers_registered_total`: A gauge of healthy workers per tenant.
    -   `master_data_assignment_duration_seconds`: A histogram of time taken to assign data.
    -   `etcd_client_latency_seconds`: Latency for `etcd` operations.
